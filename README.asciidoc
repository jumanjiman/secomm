Functionality
=============

I'm using SELinux in enforcing mode, and 
I need a directory to be writable by `smbd`, `vsftpd`, and `nfsd`.
What target types are writable by all three daemons?

----
secomm -c dir -p write smbd_t ftpd_t nfsd_t
----

In other words, what target type might I choose for my file or
directory if I need the file to be accessible for PERMISSION from
the following daemons: DAEMON1, DAEMON2, and DAEMON3

Show the intersection of SELinux target types on
which the given subject types share a common permission.

This script is similar in concept and operation to
the `comm -1 -2` command, part of GNU coreutils.

It differs from GNU `comm` in that it uses SELinux types
as inputs instead of files. The output records are
SELinux target types. The output is the list of target types that
are common to each of the input domains and constrained to the
specified SELinux permission(s) and object class(es).
